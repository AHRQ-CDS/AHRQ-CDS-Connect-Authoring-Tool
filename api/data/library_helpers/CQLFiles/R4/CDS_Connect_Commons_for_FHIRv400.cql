// CDS Connect Commons for FHIRv400
// Change log:
// - 1.0.1
//   - Fix logic for ActiveOrRecurring to use equivalence matching (instead of "in"
//     which uses equality matching)
//   - Add back ...ByConcept functions for backwards compatibility w/ libraries that
//     might expect them
//   - Consider effectiveInstant in ObservationLookBack
library CDS_Connect_Commons_for_FHIRv400 version '1.0.1'

using FHIR version '4.0.0'

// Include the FHIRHelpers library for simplifying interacton w/ the FHIR data model
