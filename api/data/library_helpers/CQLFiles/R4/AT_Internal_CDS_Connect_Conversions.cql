/**
 * This library supports conversions from one unit to another.  Conversions are added as needed by artifacts in
 * development.  Since case is important for some units, rather than use our normal PascalCasing, we use underscore
 * to separate words and maintain casing.  For example, to convert to "mg/dL", rather than call the function
 * `ToMgPerDL`, we call it `to_mg_per_dL`, in order to maintain casing.
