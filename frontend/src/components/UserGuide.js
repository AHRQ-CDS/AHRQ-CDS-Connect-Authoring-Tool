              Authoring is based on defining elements using a broad type, such as Condition, and applying one or more
              value sets and codes to specify a more specific concept, such as Diabetes. These elements can be further
              refined using expression modifiers to indicate a specific status, a most recent value, a comparison against
              a specific value, and more.

                    <li>
                      Depending on the type that was selected,

                        <li>
                          <strong>Associate the element</strong> with at least one value set or code to give it more specific

                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong>Provide additional information</strong> as prompted by specific forms.

                    After choosing a type, you may need to associate it with a Value Set or Code. If you see a button labeled
                    "Authenticate VSAC", "Add Value Set", or "Add Code", then you have selected an element type which requires you
                    to narrow it down further via terminology. These types also show a small key icon next to the name to
                    indicate you will need to authenticate with the National Library of Medicine's Values Set Authority Center
                    (VSAC).

                    If you see an "Authenticate VSAC" button, you must click it and then enter in your UMLS Terminology Services
                    account username and password. This is not the same as your CDS Authoring Tool username and password. If
                    you do not have a UMLS Terminology Services account, see <a href="#Requesting_UTS_Account">Requesting a UMLS

                  <div>
                    In the CDS Authoring Tool, authors use value sets to indicate a grouping of codes that should be used to
                    find matching items in a patient's health record. For example, a "Diabetes" value set might contain many
                    different codes that all indicate some diagnosis of Diabetes. These codes may differ in specificity or
                    sub-types (e.g., Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes) or may be from different code systems (e.g., ICD-9, ICD-10,
                    SNOMED-CT). If an author associates a value set with an element, then patient data need only match one of
                    the codes in the value set to be considered a match for the element.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    To associate a value set with an element, click on the "Add Value Set" button. If you do not see an "Add
                    Value Set" button, first authenticate with the VSAC as described in the section above. After clicking the
                    "Add Value Set" button, a modal dialog will appear allowing you to search for a value set by keyword. Enter
                    a keyword representing the value set you want to find and click the "Search" button.
                  </div>

                  </div>
                  <div>
                    After clicking "Search", a set of results will be displayed. Each item in the results represents a value set
                    in the VSAC, including its name, Object Identifier (OID), Steward, and the number of codes in the value set.
                    To see the contents of a specific value set in the results, click its name.
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    After clicking on a specific value set, its full set of codes will be displayed. Each item in the list shows
                    a contained code, its name, and its system. This allows authors to confirm that the value set contents match
                    their intent. If this value set is not a good match or you want to inspect other value sets in the results,
                    click the left arrow button near the top of the dialog. Otherwise, click the "Select" button to confirm
                    the selection of the displayed value set.

                  <div>
                    NOTE: The VSAC recently introduced a new approach toward authoring value sets that allows value sets to be
                    defined using code filters. These value sets are called intensional value sets, and while the VSAC supports
                    authoring them, it does not yet support retrieving their contents over the FHIR interface that the CDS
                    Authoring Tool uses. If you select an intensional value set, an error will be displayed indicating that the
                    codes cannot be retrieved. You can, however, still select the value set if you are confident it is the one
                    you need.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    Upon selection of the value set, the element will be updated with the value set association and a name
                    (which defaults to the value set name). Feel free to modify the name to more closely match the final intent
                    of the element. At this point, you can associate additional value sets or codes. These value sets and codes
                    will be treated as a unioned set, meaning that an item in a patient's health record need only match one of
                    any of them in order to be matched on the element as a whole.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <img alt="" src={screenshotUrl('LDL_C_Element')}

                  </div>
                  <div>
                    Associated value sets will be reflected in the expression phrase as well as listed in the element's metadata.
                    You can review a value set's contents by clicking on the eye icon{' '}
                    <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faEye} aria-hidden="true" />
                    {' '}to the right of the listed value set. You can delete the value set association by clicking the "X"
                    icon to the far right of the listed value set.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    Depending on the context of the element, you may also see a warning message indicating that the element
                    does not have the correct return type. For example, if this is an element in the Inclusions or Exclusions
                    criteria, it must have a return type "boolean" (e.g., a true or false answer). This is because every element
                    in the criteria is combined using "and" or "or" clauses to arrive at an aggregate answer: true (the patient
                    meets the criteria) or false (the patient does not meet the criteria). To satisfy the requirement for a
                    specific return type, you must <a href="#Modify_Results">modify the results</a> until the required return
                    type is achieved.

                  <div>
                    In cases where only a certain code should be used to match patient data for an element, authors can
                    associate a single code with an element without using a value set. This feature can also be used to support
                    matching on a code that is valid but is not a part of a value set that is also associated to the element.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    To associate a specific code with an element, click on the "Add Code" button. If you do not see an "Add
                    Code" button, first authenticate with the VSAC as described above. After clicking the "Add Code" button, a
                    modal dialog will appear allowing you to enter a code and select the system from which it came. Currently,
                    the CDS Authoring Tool supports the following systems, which are also supported by the VSAC: SNOMED,
                    ICD-9, ICD-10, NCI, LOINC, and RXNORM. To choose a different code system, select "Other" in the code system
                    dropdown menu and provide the FHIR-compatible identifying URL for the code system. Once you've entered the
                    code and selected the appropriate system, click the "Validate" button.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <img alt="" src={screenshotUrl('VSAC_Enter_Code')}

                  </div>
                  <div>
                    After clicking "Validate", the CDS Authoring Tool will send the code to the VSAC for validation. If the code
                    is from a supported code system and verified by VSAC, the CDS Authoring Tool will display the code, its
                    system, and its display text. You can confirm the selection by clicking on the "Select" button at the
                    bottom of the dialog.
                  </div>
                  <div>

                  </div>
                  <div>
                    If the code fails validation, this means the code is invalid or the code system is not supported. In either
                    case, an error will be shown at the bottom of the dialog. You can choose to modify the code and try again,
                    cancel the code selection process, or select the code despite the validation error. To cancel the code
                    selection, click the "Cancel" button at the bottom of the dialog. To select the code anyway, click the
                    "Select" button at the bottom of the dialog.

                    All elements provide a user-configurable field for the element name. In some cases, the
                    element name may be pre-populated, but you may change the name if desired. It's considered a best practice
                    to reflect the intent of the element in its name. For example, if an element checks for an LDL cholesterol
                    test with a result over 130 mg/dL, then "LDL-c &gt; 130 mg/dL" is a better name than just "LDL-c Test".

                        Providing a simple summary of complex logic that is encapsulated in the element, or just further
                        explaining the element built
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Indicating a source from which the element's logic is derived and providing any necessary references

                      <li>
                        Indicating a section of logic that implementers may want to modify based on specific site needs

                    When an element's comment field contains information, the comments icon changes to a subtle blue color
                    and contains three dots. This allows authors to quickly see which elements have comments, even when the
                    comments are collapsed.

                    Some element types reqest additional information. Currently, the following two element types require
                    additional information:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Demographics {'->'} Age Range</strong> requires at least one of: Minimum Age, Maximum Age; as well
                        as the unit of time (e.g., years).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Demographics {'->'} Gender</strong> requires one of the following values to be selected:
                        Male, Female, Other, Unknown.
                      </li>

                  <div>
                    Once you have the core element defined, including associated value sets and codes (if applicable), its
                    return type will be displayed near the bottom of the element. For elements with FHIR-based types (e.g.,
                    Condition, Observation, etc.), the return-type will be a list of items matching that type (e.g., List of
                    Conditions). In some cases, the default return type is incompatible with the context in which it is used and
                    should be modified to meet the requirements of the context. In other cases, the return type may be compatible,
                    but the author may want to further filter the results.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    CDS Authors can use "modifier expressions" to further define or narrow an element's intent. For example, if
                    you have a "Condition" element associated with a "Diabetes" value set, its initial return type will be:
                    "List of Diabetes". You can then apply the "Confirmed" expression modifier to filter the results to only those
                    with a confirmed clinical status, and finally apply the "Exists" expression modifier to check that at least
                    one result for this query exists in the patient's record. Since the return type of the "Exists" expression
                    modifier is "Boolean", this satisfies the requirement for boolean return types in the Inclusions and
                    Exclusions tabs.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    To apply an expression modifier to an element, click on the "Expressions" button near the bottom of the
                    element box. When you do this, a set of buttons will be displayed indicating the possible expression
                    modifiers that can be applied to the current element.
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    Expression modifiers can be chained onto one another in succession. The return type from the first expression
                    modifier that is applied will affect the types of expression modifiers that can be applied as the second, and
                    so on. The CDS Authoring Tool performs this filtering for the author automatically, always showing only the
                    expression modifiers that are valid in the current context.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    Expression modifiers and their value (when applicable) are shown as a list in the main body of the element
                    box. The element type, its associations, and its expression modifiers are also used to display a user-friendly
                    phrase that summarizes the calculated intent of the element. For the example above, the generated phrase
                    would be "There exists a confirmed condition with a code from Diabetes." As you modify the element, the CDS
                    Authoring Tool will update its expression phrase automatically.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <img alt="" src={screenshotUrl('Expression_Phrase')}

                  <div>
                    If you need to remove expression modifiers, you must remove them one at a time, starting with the last one.
                    To remove an expression modifier, click on the "X" on the far right hand side of the expression modifier's
                    row in the element's content. It is currently not possible to directly remove expression modifiers in the
                    middle of the expression modifier list because this might change the current return type at that point and
                    render the rest of the expression modifier list invalid.

                  click the "X" button in the top-right corner of the element's box. Currently, the CDS Authoring Tool does not
                  require authors to confirm deletion; the element is deleted immediately. This action cannot be undone.

                <div>
                  While elements can be useful on their own, usually they are combined with other elements in order to represent
                  more complex ideas or requirements. The CDS Authoring Tool supports the following ways of combining elements:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>And</strong>: Require every element in a set of boolean elements to be true</li>
                    <li><strong>Or</strong>: Require at least one element in a set of boolean elements to be true</li>
                    <li><strong>Indented Group</strong>: Group a set of elements together to represent a single logical unit</li>
                    <li><strong>Intersect</strong>: Find the set of items that occur in each element of a set of elements</li>
                    <li><strong>Union</strong>: Combine items from multiple elements into a single set of items</li>
                  </ul>

                  <div>
                    Combining elements using "And" indicates that each of the elements should evaluate to a "true" result in order
                    for the logic to be satisfied. For example, you might combine an Age Range element and a Gender element using
                    "And" to indicate that a patient must be 40 - 75 years old AND male. Elements must have a boolean return
                    type in order to be combined using "And".

                    The Inclusions, Exclusions, and Subpopulations tabs all require elements to be combined using And, Or, or
                    indented groups. In these tabs, you can combine elements using "And" by clicking the dropdown between
                    elements and selecting "And". The CDS Authoring Tool requires that all sibling elements (e.g., elements
                    indented at the same level) use the same combination logic, so when you select "And" between two elements,
                    it will also be selected for all other elements at the same indent level.

                    In the Base Elements tab, elements can be combined using the "List Operations" element type. Do this by
                    choosing "List Operations" in the element type dropdown and then selecting "And" in the second dropdown. This
                    will create a group that you can give a unique name and begin adding elements to.

                  <div>
                    Combining elements using "Or" indicates that at least one of the elements should evaluate to a "true" result
                    in order for the logic to be satisfied. For example, you might combine an LDL-c element and a Diabetes element
                    to indicate that a patient should have an LDL cholesterol reading above a certain threshold or a diagnosis of
                    diabetes. Elements must have a boolean return type in order to be combined using "Or".

                    Sometimes authors need to create complex logic that requires the use of "And" and "Or" at the same time.
                    This is accomplished by creating and combining sub-groups of elements. For example, you might want to
                    indicate that a patient must be 40 - 75 years old and have either an LDL cholesterol reading above a certain
                    threshold or a diagnosis of diabetes. To do this, you would create the first two elements as described in
                    the <a href="#And">And</a> section above, but then you would convert the second element to an indented group
                    and add the third element to that indented group, combining it using <a href="#Or">Or</a>.

                    To create a new indented group, create the first element that should go in the indented group as normal.
                    Then click on the "indent" button{' '}

                    type. Do this by choosing "List Operations" in the element type dropdown and then selecting "Intersect" in
                    the second dropdown. This will create a group that you can give a unique name and begin adding elements to.
                    All of the elements in the group will be intersected together. Since intersection requires elements to have
                    returned items in common, the elements in an intersected group should all have the same result type,
                    otherwise it is impossible for any item to match against all of the elements.

                    Combining elements using "Union" indicates that all of the items across all of the elements should be

                  receive a recommendation.

                  the Exclusions tab can prevent them from being in the general population for which this artifact's

                  Authors use the Subpopulations tab to specify criteria that groups patients into subpopulation that can be
                  associated with more specific recommendations. While subpopulations are not required, they can be useful for
                  artifacts that need to deliver more nuanced recommendations or recommendations that are population-specific.
                  For example, a statin artifact might deliver a different strength recommendation for a patient with a 10-year
                  risk score of 8% versus a patient with a 10-year risk score of 12%.

                    Authors can reference and use Base Elements in the Inclusions tab, Exclusions tab, and Subpopulations tab.
                    To use a base element, it must be created in the Base Elements tab first. After that, use it in any valid
                    location by selecting the "Base Elements" type in the element type dropdown. A second dropdown will appear

                    An element that is based on a base element is shaded light blue to make it more easily distinguishable.
                    In addition, it lists the original base element's name in the content of its element definition
                    using the "Base Element" label. If you click the link icon{' '}
                    <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLink} className="delete-valueset-button" aria-hidden="true" />
                    {' '}to the far right of the base element's name, you will go directly to the base element definition.

                  <div>
                    If the base element does not have the return type required by its context (for example, if it is used in the
                    Inclusions tab but does not have a boolean return type), you can add expression modifiers to it in much the
                    same way as you would any element. In this case, the expression modifiers added to the use of the base
                    element will not affect the original definition of the base element in the Base Elements tab. This allows
                    base elements to used in a broad set of contexts in differing ways.

                  <div>
                    When a Base Element has been used, the definition of the element in the Base Elements tab will show where
                    it is being used. This is indicated by rows labeled "Element Use" in the content of the element definition.
                    If you click the link icon{' '}

                  <div>
                    Note that when a base element is used, certain restrictions are put into place. One restriction is that you
                    cannot delete it. To delete a base element that is being used, you must first delete (or edit) all of its
                    uses.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    Another restriction is that applied expressions cannot be removed if doing so would change the Base Element's
                    return type. This ensures that modifying a base element does not make its uses become invalid. In order
                    to remove the expression, first delete all uses of the Base Element in the artifact.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    In addition, expression modifiers cannot be added to base elements that are being used, unless the expression
                    modifier does not change the overall return type of the element. If the expression modifier would change the
                    return type of the base element, then you must first remove all uses of the Base Element in the artifact
                    before you can add the expression modifier.

                  For the simplest cases, authors specify a single recommendation which will be delivered for any patient who
                  meets the Inclusions criteria but does not meet any Exclusions criteria. For more advanced cases, authors can
                  specify recommendations tailored to specific subpopulations.

                    For CDS artifacts that may deliver more than one recommendation, authors must associate recommendations with
                    the subpopulations to which they apply. The CDS Authoring Tool includes the following subpopulations by
                    default:

                      <li>
                        <strong>Doesn't Meet Inclusion Criteria</strong>: Patients who don't meet the inclusion criteria usually
                        will not receive a recommendation, but associating a recommendation with this subpopulation allows
                        you to still deliver a notice for these patients.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Meets Exclusion Criteria</strong>: Patients who meet the exclusion criteria usually will not

                  Parameters allow authors to create named elements whose values can be supplied by the CDS execution environment
                  at run-time. Authors can specify default values for parameters, but are not required to do so. Parameters
                  provide a useful approach for allowing certain aspects of CDS behavior to be tailored for specific environments
                  without the need to modify the CDS logic itself. For example, an artifact that is capable of delivering grade B
                  and grade C recommendations might specify a parameter called "Allow Grade C" with a default value: true. At
                  sites where grade C recommendations are not allowed, the CDS can be run with the parameter value set to false
                  in order to supress grade C recommendations. The author, of course, needs to properly use the parameter in
                  their logic to implement this behavior. To support this, parameters can be referred to in elements throughout
                  the CDS logic (much like base elements).

                    Authors can define as many parameters as they'd like. To create a parameter, click the "New parameter"
                    button. An empty parameter box will be displayed with fields for the parameter name, user-provided comments,
                    the parameter type, and an optional default value.

                  <div>
                    The parameter name should reflect the purpose of the parameter, making it easier for implementers to
                    understand what it represents and how it might affect the artifact. The comments box, however, can be used
                    to provide additional information about the parameter and its affect on the behavior of the artifact.

                  <div>
                    The parameter type provides a dropdown selection of available parameter types: Boolean, Code, Concept,
                    Integer, DateTime, Decimal, Quantity, String, Time, Interval&lt;Integer&gt;, Interval&lt;DateTime&gt;,
                    Interval&lt;Decimal&gt;, and Interval&lt;Quantity&gt;. Once you've selected a parameter type, the default
                    value editor will provide an appropriate interface for editing the type of value you chose. Specifying a
                    default value is optional, but if no default value is specified, then implementers must specify a value for
                    that parameter at run-time.

                    any valid location by selecting the "Parameters" type in the element type dropdown. A second dropdown will
                    appear allowing you to choose the Parameter you want.

                    An element using a parameter indicates the parameter in its expression phrase as well as listing the
                    parameter's name in the content of its element definition using the "Parameter" label. If you click the link

                  <div>
                    If the parameter does not have the return type required by its context (for example, if it is used in the
                    Inclusions tab but does not have a boolean return type), you can add expression modifiers to it in much the
                    same way as you would any element.

                    its parameter type be changed. To delete a parameter or change its type, you must first delete (or edit) all

                  Authors use the "Handle Errors" tab to define what messages should be provided to end users when certain error
                  conditions arise. For example, an author might want to return an error message if required data is missing from
                  the patient's health record. Handling errors is optional and may not be required or useful for certain use
                  cases.

                  NOTE: Although CQL 1.2 introduced the "Messages" function to allow authors to return error messages to the
                  operating environment at run-time, the CDS Authoring Tool does not currently use this approach. Instead, it
                  creates a CQL statement called "Errors" that will return a list of the errors that are applicable to the
                  patient in context. Each error in the list is a simple text string. Although the result is a list, the CDS
                  Authoring Tool is currently only capable of returning one error per invocation, so the list length will never
                  be more than one.

                  <div>
                    Authors specify error handling by chaining together conditional "If" statements, indicating that if a certain
                    condition (or set of conditions) is met, then a certain error message should be returned. By default, the
                    CDS Authoring Tool provides three initial conditions that can be used when specifying errors:
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Recommendations is null</strong>: indicates that no recommendation was provided.</li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Doesn't Meet Inclusion Criteria</strong>: indicates that the patient didn't meet the initial
                        criteria to receive the recommensation.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Meets Exclusion Criteria</strong>: indicates that the patient met the criteria that automatically
                        excludes them from receiving the recommendation regardless of whether or not they met the inclusion
                        criteria.

                    </ul>
                    In addition to the conditions above, authors can select subpopulations or boolean-valued parameters as
                    conditions to indicate when an error message should be returned.

                    rarely used at the top-level, as most CDS should not return any error if everything runs smoothly. In nested
                    conditions (started by "And Also If..."), however, the "Else" box can be used to specify an error if the
                    top-level condition was met, but none of the sub-conditions were met. If the "Else" text box is left empty,
                    no error message will be returned if no other error condition has been satisfied.

                    FHIRHelpers. If you want to upload a library that depends on other libraries (using CQL's "include" keyword),
                    you must upload a zip file containing the library and its dependencies.

                    you must first delete any uses of it in the artifact and/or the external libraries that declare it as a
                    dependency.

                    using functions from external CQL libraries. To use an external CQL element, select the "External CQL" type
                    in the element type dropdown in place an element can be created. A second dropdown will appear allowing you
                    to choose the External CQL library that contains the definition you wish to use. After selecting a library,
                    a third dropdown will appear allowing you to choose the specific parameter or definition to use.

                  <div>
                    After selecting the external CQL parameter or definition, it will be reflectect in the element's expression
                    phrase and listed in the element's metadata using the label "External CQL Element". If you wish (or if
                    required), you can add expression modifiers to the element in much the same way as you would any element.
                    In this case, the expression modifiers added to the use of the external CQL element will not affect the
                    original definition of the external CQL element.

                    Note that when an external CQL element is used, it prevents the external CQL library from being deleted from
                    the artifact. To delete the external CQL library, you must first delete its use. In addition, the first time
                    you use external CQL in an artifact, that artifact will become locked into the same version of FHIR that the
                    external CQL uses. After this, you cannot download the artifact as other versions of FHIR nor can you test
                    the artifact against synthetic patient data using another version of FHIR.

                While CDS artifacts should always be tested in the environment where they are deployed, testing is an important
                part of the artifact development process as well. Testing CDS logic before it is deployed in a test environment
                allows authors to discover and fix bugs earlier in the process, saving both time and money. This also makes it
                easier to distinguish between bugs in the logic and bugs in the data or integration environment. To test your
                artifacts, click on the "Testing" link in the Clinical Decision Support Authoring banner near the top of the page.

                The CDS Authoring Tool testing view allows authors to upload their own synthetic test patients as FHIR bundles of
                synthetic patient data. The author can then run their CDS logic against one or more of these patients and inspect
                the results to determine if they are as expected. The CDS Authoring Tool does not currently provide a test
                patient editor, nor does it provide a mechanism for automated verification of results (e.g., "test assertions").

                  The first step in testing an artifact is to upload synthetic patient data to the CDS Authoring Tool. The CDS
                  Authoring Tool environment is not appropriate for real patient data (whether de-identified or not). Only
                  synthetic data should be used. Patient data should be uploaded as a FHIR bundle (DSTU2, STU3, or R4). Authors
                  familiar with FHIR can use their tool of choice to create patient test data. Popular options include

                  Once your test patients have been uploaded (see section above), you can run any compatible CDS artifact against
                  them. Compatible artifacts are artifacts that can be exported using the same version of FHIR as the patient data
                  is encoded in. Note that some artifacts may not be compatible with your patients because the artifact is locked
                  to a specific version of FHIR based on the external CQL it uses.
                </div>
                <div>
                  In order to run the CDS artifact's CQL, the CDS Authoring Tool must request additional value set information
                  (e.g., the set of codes) from the Value Set Authority Center. If you see an "Authenticate VSAC" button, you
                  must first click it and then enter in your UMLS Terminology Services account username and password (this is not
                  the same as your CDS Authoring Tool username and password). After you authenticate, you will see a new button
                  titled "Execute CQL on Selected Patients".

                  patients that use the same version of FHIR. The CDS Authoring Tool does not support operating on multiple
                  versions of FHIR in a single test run. After selecting the patients you want to test click the "Execute CQL on
                  Selected Patients" button to open the testing details modal dialog.

                  different version of FHIR than the patients you have selectec. If the artifact you selected has parameters
                  defined, an additional field will display for each parameter with the default value preselected. You can use
                  these fields to override the default values. After populating the parameter values (if applicable), click on
