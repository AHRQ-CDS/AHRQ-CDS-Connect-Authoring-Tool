            <p>
              The Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Authoring Tool is a web-based application aimed at simplifying the
              creation of production-ready CQL code. The project is based on "templates" (e.g. Condition, Observation,
              etc.), which can have value sets or codes applied to narrow in on more specific concepts. Expression
              modifiers are included to allow for more flexible definitions (e.g. most recent, value comparisons, etc.).
            </p>

            <p>
              The CDS Authoring Tool is part of the CDS Connect project, sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare
              Research and Quality (AHRQ), and developed under contract with AHRQ by MITRE's CMS Alliance to Modernize
              Healthcare (CAMH) FFRDC.
            </p>

            <p>
              This document helps new users of the CDS Authoring Tool navigate the features of the application and
              acquire the knowledge of how to use the tool to build CDS artifacts.

                  Elements are the main building blocks for an artifact. Each artifact represents different conditions,
                  medications, demographics, etc. Using a combination of elements together in groups (covered below in
                  Section 3.6 "Logic Elements") helps the user define different populations for the artifact.

                  <li>
                    The "Return Type" gives the current return type of this element based on the Expressions (more in

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Some elements have more fields to fill in beyond just the "Element Name". For example, the "Gender"
                    element requires the user to select which gender is desired, using the select menu. Fill out every field
                    in an element to ensure proper CQL code is generated.

                  <li>
                    Some elements do not support expressions. These elements will not have an "Add Expression" button. For
                    example, "Gender" does not have any expressions that can be applied to it, and automatically returns a
                    Boolean value.

                <h3 id="Expressions">3.4 Expressions</h3>

                <p>
                  Expressions modify an Element to define or narrow its intent. Many Elements will start as a list,
                  which if left as such, <em>will generate invalid CQL</em> when used in Inclusions, Exclusions, or
                  Subpopulations. Since elements are used in boolean logic (e.g., and, or), the user must ensure that
                  the Return Type of every Element returns a "Boolean" value (e.g., true or false). To achieve this,
                  the user can apply Expressions to narrow or filter the previous Expression further. For example, one
                  could start with a list of Diabetes Conditions, then apply the "Confirmed" Expression to find the
                  conditions with a Confirmed status, then apply "Exists" to achieve a Boolean Return Type
                  (pictured below).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Expressions chain onto one another in succession. The Return Type from the first Expression applied will
                  narrow the types of Expressions that can be applied as the second, and so on. The CDS Authoring Tool
                  performs this filtering for the user automatically.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Expressions are also visually represented as a single phrase on each element. The phrase compiles all
                  Expressions applied to an element into a single phrase. Value Sets, Codes, and any additional fields
                  on an element are also included. The Expression Phrase serves as a way to quickly describe the value
                  of the Element. As any of the values change, the phrase updates automatically.

                  </li>

                  <li>
                    The last Expression that has been applied will appear at the bottom of the Expression list, directly above
                    the "Return Type" label.  In this case, the "Exists" expression is used to determine if the list of
                    Confirmed Diabetes Conditions has items or is empty.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    The last Expression can be removed by clicking the "Remove last expression" button on the far right side
                    of the Expression item. Because of the nature of the Expression chaining, only the last Expression can be
                    deleted. If the user wishes to delete an Expression higher up in the list, they must first delete all the
                    ones below it.

                <p>
                  Logic Elements are groups of Elements tied together by a particular conjunction, "And" or "Or". By stringing
                  Elements together with conjunctions, a set of logic can be created to define a population.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <img
                    alt="Basic Logic Element"
                    src={screenshotUrl('Basic_Logic_Element')}
                  className="img-fluid img-thumbnail rounded mx-auto d-block" />
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Between every Element inside a Logic Element group, there will be a "Select conjunction type" dropdown
                    denoting the conjunction used to tie them together. The options for conjunctions are "And" or "Or". Note
                    that within any particular group, the same conjunction must be used. For instance, in the example above,
                    if one changes the first occurrence of the conjunction (the first (2) marker) to "Or", the second
                    conjunction will also update to "Or". This avoids creating ambiguous logic for the system to interpret.
                    The user can think of "And" as meaning every Element must be true, while "Or" means at least one of the
                    Elements must be true.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Every Logic Element will have an Element Picker (Section 3.2) at the bottom to allow the user to
                    add new Elements to the group.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                  Logic Elements can also be "nested", which is to say, Logic Elements can have other Logic Elements inside
                  them. Logic Elements can be nested as much as the user desires. Using the Indent/Outdent buttons helps the
                  user quickly group and ungroup individual Elements and entire Logic Element groups.

                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    A nested Logic Element is represented by a darker colored grey background.
                  </li>

                  <li>Nested Logic Elements can be named using the "Group Name" field, similar to Elements.</li>

                  <li>
                    Entire Logic Element groups can be indented or outdented, similar to individual Elements. This helps
                    the user move entire groups, rather than just one Element at a time.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Again, note that every logic element group will have its own Element Picker, allowing the user to
                    add more Elements or nested Logic Elements to the group.

                <p>
                  The Inclusions section uses Elements, Expressions, and Logic Elements to create a target population that is
                  qualified to receive a Recommendation from the Artifact. The Inclusions population, with the Exclusions
                  population filtered out, creates the general population for the Artifact. Every interaction required to
                  build Inclusions is covered in the above sections.

                  generally excluded from receiving a Recommendation from the Artifact. The population matching Exclusions are
                  filtered out of the Inclusions population, which creates the general population for the Artifact. Every

                  The Subpopulations section uses Elements, Expressions, and Logic Elements to create named target
                  populations, which can then be applied to a Recommendation. This helps the user further filter the
                  general population created from the combination of Inclusions and Exclusions. There are two default
                  "Subpopulations" that can be applied to a recommendation, "Doesn't Meet Inclusion Criteria" and "Meets
                  Exclusion Criteria" (more in section 3.11 Recommendations). Most interactions required to build
                  Subpopulations are covered in above sections, but Subpopulations has a few differences.

                    Base Elements can also be a Logic Element. Base Element Logic Elements work the same as Logic Elements
                    in other tabs; they combine multiple elements into one group using an And or an Or. For more information
                    about Logic Elements, see Section 3.6. Logic Elements in this tab also work very similarly to List Groups
                    in this tab. They can be added to Base Elements by choosing "List Operations" and choosing "And" or "Or".

                <p>
                  Recommendations are the resulting notices that should be delivered to the clinician after the CDS
                  Artifact is executed. Recommendations are written as free text and can have an accompanying Rationale.
                  Most Recommendations will apply to the population that meets Inclusion logic and does not meet Exclusions
                  logic. Subpopulations, either the default options or the subpopulations the user built, can be applied to
                  a Recommendation.

                  <li>
                    The Recommendation's content is written in free text using the "Recommendation" text area. This is the
                    message that the clinician will read in the EHR if the Recommendation is triggered.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Clicking the "Add rationale" button will append an additional free text field where the user can enter the
                    supporting evidence or reasoning for the Recommendation. This is covered below.

                  <li>
                    Recommendations can be further filtered by Subpopulations, which is performed by clicking the "Add

                    "Doesn't Meet Inclusion Criteria" is one of the default Subpopulation options. This default option is
                    supplied to allow the user to add Recommendations for patients who did not meet the Inclusion criteria
                    and thus were not part of the general population for this CDS Artifact.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    "Meets Exclusion Criteria" is one of the default Subpopulation options. This default option is supplied
                    to allow the user to add Recommendations for patients who met the Exclusion criteria and thus were not
                    part of the general population for this CDS Artifact.

                <p>
                  Parameters allow the user to create named, reusable values that can be supplied by the CDS execution
                  environment at run-time. Parameters can be defined with or without default values. The naming of the
                  Parameter should be readable and communicate its intent within the resulting CQL code. An example of
                  this might be a Parameter called "AllowGradeC" to indicate if grade C recommendation should be
                  returned or not. It might default to "true", but individual implementations can choose to override it
                  to "false" if they do not allow or want Grade C recommendations. Parameters are optional additions to
                  the artifact. They can be used in building Inclusions, Exclusions, and Subpopulations, and can be
                  used in Error Handling.

                  The "Handle Errors" tab is an area to optionally direct the system how to handle various errors that may
                  be encountered when running the CDS Artifact. This allows the user to define what error messages to display
                  when certain situations are encountered, such as when data is missing. Error handling is built by chaining
                  together "If" statements, which say "if this condition is met, then deliver this error message."
